Yesterday 15 February 2024, Google's [ChromeOS & Chrome Enterprise](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/chrome-enterprise/){:target=”_blank”} released an article detailing the [benefits of ChromeOS Flex](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/chrome-enterprise/11-ways-you-win-with-chromeos-flex){:target=”_blank”}, their new operating system that targets older computers. It coincided with their [somewhat awkward tie-in with Valentine’s day](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7163589989543473152/){:target=”_blank”}. But seriously, with ChromeOS Flex, Google is taking aim at old computers, particularly those that will become [defunct in October 2025](https://www.neowin.net/news/240-million-pcs-could-end-up-in-landfills-when-windows-10-support-ends/){:target=”_blank”}, when Microsoft ceases support for computers that cannot run the current Windows 11. Immediately there were responses from the IT media, recognising the situation that ChromeOS Flex may well help avert an e-waste catastrophe, saving up to [240 million PCs](https://www.canalys.com/insights/end-of-windows-10-support-could-turn-240-million-pcs-into-e-waste){:target=”_blank”} from landfill.

Here at the South Perth Learning Centre, we have been doing this for several years now. When COVID-19 hit in early 2020, many of our mostly senior clientele suddenly required access to technology. We provided working computers by taking old computers, erasing the old Microsoft Windows operating system (mostly Windows 7 at the time), and installing leaner, meaner operating systems such as ChromeOS Flex (or its previous incarnation [Neverware CloudReady](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neverware#CloudReady){:target=”_blank”}) and [Linux Mint](http://linuxmint.com/){:target=”_blank”}. We also provided affordable internet connections. For this, we sourced discarded [Vividwireless](https://www.itnews.com.au/news/optus-to-retire-vividwireless-516543){:target=”_blank”} Huawei B315s 4G modems that were aplenty since Optus took it over in 2012 then shut it down in 2019 (turns out these modems could be easily unlocked from the Optus network by pressing the subtly hidden 'Reset' button on the back with a straightened out paper clip).

We currently continue this practice with a social initiative where our members donate their old computers, and we install ChromeOS Flex or Linux Mint on it. These OS-rejuvenated computers are then passed on to [CARAD - Centre for Asylum Seekers, Refugees, and Detainees](https://www.linkedin.com/company/centre-for-asylum-seekers-refugees-and-detainees/){:target=”_blank”} for their clients.

I am glad to see that the practice of rejuvenating old computers simply by wiping Microsoft Windows and installing a different operating system is starting to gain mainstream attention. It must be pointed out that this is very different to 'refurbishing' a computer, because zero cost is involved. The leaner and meaner alternative operating systems such as ChromeOS Flex and Linux Mint are free downloads, therefore the much preferable route over refurbishing a computer. There is indeed significant scope for ChromeOS Flex and Linux Mint to feature in community non-profit initiatives concerned with [device affordability](https://www.thesmithfamily.com.au/media/centre/releases/2023/affordability-accessibility-and-digital-skills-essential){:target=”_blank”}, [e-waste](https://www.cleanup.org.au/e-waste){:target=”_blank”} and the [circular economy](https://www.dcceew.gov.au/environment/protection/circular-economy){:target=”_blank”}.

We hope to see this practice of rejuvenating old computers with a free operating system upgrade spread like a wildfire! Imagine all those 240 million Windows 10 PCs out there, saved from landfill and put back into service. If you have an old computer at the back of your closet, why not try this out?
