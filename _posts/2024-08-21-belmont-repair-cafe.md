The Belmont Repair Cafe runs every 2nd Saturday at Perth Alliance Church, 1:00 pm - 2:30 pm. 'Toss it away? No way!'.

We are part of the [global Repair Cafe](https://www.repaircafe.org/en/about/){:target=”_blank”} movement that advocates repair instead of buying a new one.

We also provide tech help to help you with your smartphone, tablet or computer.
