My first ever blog article was written in 2005. There was plenty to write about--I had just started a 3-month residency at a jazz club in Shanghai as pianist for [Nikki Doll and The Voodoo Blue](https://musiclessons.didi.com.au/img/Nikki800px.jpg). It was my first time in mainland China, where I would spend most of the next 4 years. That blog was quite primitive, written on a single hand-coded HTML file, with a URL that was distributed to my gig mailing list at the time. It lasted about 4-5 posts.

About a year later, I went all hi-tech, and upgraded to this newfangled dynamic CMS called WordPress. My blog 'articles' were however more ads for gigs than actual articles. At the time, it was difficult to find a WP theme that I liked out of the box (still is), so I soon moved on to [RapidWeaver](https://www.realmacsoftware.com/rapidweaver/), a static CMS that lived on a MacBook, and FTP'd everything online at the touch of a button. Now RapidWeaver I loved, so simple and good-looking! I must have made 10-15 different RapidWeaver websites for myself and various organisations. The pièce de résistance was a WordPress installation embedded into a RapidWeaver website ([it's still around](http://didi.com.au/pre2012/)).

Fast forward almost 20 years since my last blog article, I am having another go at it. My wife Juliet suggested that I write about what I am currently most passionate about. So here it is, 'Musings on Technology and Sustainability', let's see if this gets past 5 posts. And I hope you get something out of it! :)
